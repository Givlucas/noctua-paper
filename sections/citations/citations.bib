abstract = {Publisher Summary
The choice of Internet protocol (IP) for the backbone of the next generation networks has defined the DNA of IP multimedia subsystem (IMS). This chapter examines essential concepts of Internet protocol (IP) networks that are required for engineering IMS networks. These focus on the addressing and routing. The current implementation of IP networks, referred to as IPv4, uses a 32-bit address space. This becomes a limitation while connecting a large set of devices. IPv6 overcomes this limitation and proposes a set of other improvements for improving quality of service and multicasting support. IPv6 is the recommended backbone for IMS. Its limited availability so far has pushed for working with IPv4 and resolving the necessary constraints. Network address translation traversal is one such problem that disrupts an IP application signaling packet such as session initiation protocol, containing low-level address information to be interpreted correctly when traversing through an internal and external network.}
